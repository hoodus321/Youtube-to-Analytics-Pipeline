This portion of the pipeline occured in the coref gpt and contractions folder.

First, we converted SRT to TXT using pysrt. simple

Next, we used a library called contractions that uses a dictionary to just replace commonly found contractions with the uncontracted form

Then, we used spacy to identify words ending in 's to then determine if that word is possessive or should be contracted with that next script.

After that, we ran the coreference resolution using our chatgpt api and the prompt for all of our videos.

Now, we are going to identify duplicate videos in our data and also try to develop a process to find those and also any videos that were cut off from ChatGPT due to the API crapping out.
